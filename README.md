# Portfolio

Having a responsive website is very important in order to display the contents accurately - considering the varying screen sizes. Using Bootstrap - I created a responsive portfolio to allow future employers/co workers access to my work, obtain a small understanding of me personally, lastly to submit their contact information (with future developments). 

The first tab to my portfolio, "About", has an image and a short personal/professional summary. I also made sure to include links to my Github, Linkedin, a PDF of my resume and my email.

The second tab, "Portfolio", contains 2 highlighted homework assignments and my first group project. For each, I included a screen shot of the deployed version, in addition to a link to the Github affiliation. 

The final tab, "Contact", is not currently functional. However, in the future, the user could enter their contact information that would be saved on the back end.
